## UltimaX Math Library \(175\+ Functions\)


</div>

### Description

This math library handles 2D Vectors, 3D Vectors, 4D Vectors, 3x3 Matrix, 4x4 Matrix, Color, and Quaternions.

The 2D Vectors, 3D Vectors, 4D Vectors, and Color all have linear and hermit spline interpolation. Also, the vectors

handle easy/advanced collision detection routines, advanced quaternion and matrix functions, and much more. This is 100%

worked out math functions, no calls to DirectX or any other API's. (*Other than the normal Cos(), Sin(), Sqrt(), etc*)

This was all done in C++ and made into a .dll for speed considerations. There are 2 main reasons I made this. 1) For my

game engine (*UltimaX*) that is being totally redone 2) For educational purposes. I wanted to learn C++ a little better

and I thought this would be a great learning experience, and it has been. Thats why I posted it, so you can learn from it

too. Not every functions has been tested yet, so if there are any problems please let me know. Enjoy this and learn!
